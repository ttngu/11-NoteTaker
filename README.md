  ## Notes about this assignment 
  I had some trouble with this assignment. The notes are able to be deleted from the db.json file, but will not delete from the browser view. To me, this doesn't make sense because if there is not info in the db.json file, there should not be any notes displayed?

  ## Tests
  Run the following command to run tests:
